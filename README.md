The BlufordCoin is the first charity token on the BSC-20. Our goal is to raise $50M for one of the 5 selected charities.

The choice of the charity will be given by the astronaut Victor Glover, why? Because if Guion Bluford is the first African-American to have been in space, Glover is the first to have stayed there. This is exactly the philosophy of this token : reach the moon and remain here forever, while supporting who we care about.
